God (via Joshua) led the new generation of Israel through the Jordan River to begin a new life obeying God in a new land. John dipped people in the waters of the Jordan River who were repenting from their sins and getting prepared for Kingdom life. Jesus went down into the waters of the Jordan River to be baptized by John and came out the other side to go into the wilderness for 40 days to show that he was re-playing Israel as the new Israel but doing it rightly, faithfully, in full obedience to God.

Historically, there have been only a few [Jewish] Temples: (1) the skin tent Tabernacle built by Moses in the wilderness; (2) the majestic stone and gold Temple built by King Solomon in Jerusalem and destroyed by Babylon; (3) the smaller temple rebuilt along with Jerusalem city under Nehemiah and Zerubbabel and then expanded by King Herod just before Jesus' birth.  This temple was destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D. (4) Jesus' body was a \"temple\" (a place where God and humanity met). (5) The New Testament teaches that Christians are now God's temple, because his Spirit dwells in them. \nTemples are houses for idols of pagan gods.",
